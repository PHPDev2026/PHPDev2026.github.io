        <div class="step-content">
          <h4>Initial Discussion</h4>
          <p>Send me details about your bug or project. I'll ask clarifying questions and provide an honest assessment of timeline, approach, and cost. No pressure, no hard sell—just transparent advice on whether I'm the right fit.</p>
        </div>

          <h4>Proposal & Agreement</h4>
          <p>I'll outline scope, deliverables, timeline, and cost in writing. Once agreed, we move forward with clear expectations—no scope creep, no surprises. You'll know exactly what you're getting and when.</p>

          <h4>Execution & Updates</h4>
          <p>I start work immediately. You receive regular written updates on progress, any issues discovered, and next steps. Everything is tracked and documented so you always know the status.</p>

          <h4>Testing & Quality Assurance</h4>
          <p>Thorough testing before delivery. I don't ship broken code. Everything is validated, tested across scenarios, and confirmed to work as expected before you see it.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>What's your typical turnaround time?</h4>
      <p>Small bug fixes: same day or next day. Medium features: 1-3 days. Complete applications: 3-7 days depending on complexity. I work fast—what others quote in weeks, I typically deliver in days. For urgent work, same-day fixes are usually possible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>Do you work hourly or project-based?</h4>
      <p>Both, depending on what makes sense. Hourly (£30-50/hour) for ongoing work or tasks with uncertain scope. Fixed-price for well-defined projects. Typical costs: bug fixes £60-200, small features £240-600. Retainer arrangements available for consistent monthly work.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>What timezone are you in?</h4>
      <p>UK-based (GMT/BST). I primarily use asynchronous text communication (email, chat) which works well across timezones—we don't need to be online simultaneously. I respond during UK business hours but can accommodate urgent issues outside normal hours.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>Can you work with my existing codebase?</h4>
      <p>Absolutely. I regularly work on legacy PHP code, inherited projects, and messy codebases. I can debug, refactor, extend, or optimize existing applications regardless of their current state. Even if the previous developer is gone and documentation is missing, I can figure it out.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>Do you work with Laravel specifically?</h4>
      <p>Yes. For complex applications that need structure and best practices, I use Laravel. For simpler projects, existing code, or quick fixes, I work in standard PHP. The goal is always solving your problem with the right tool, not forcing a particular framework.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>Do you sign NDAs or work agreements?</h4>
      <p>Absolutely. I'm happy to sign NDAs, work-for-hire agreements, or any standard contracts. Your code and data remain completely confidential. I never reuse client code or share project details without permission.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>What if I need changes after delivery?</h4>
      <p>Post-delivery support is included to fix any bugs or issues that arise from my work—no additional charge for genuine bugs. Additional features or scope changes beyond the original agreement are quoted separately at standard rates.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>What payment methods do you accept?</h4>
      <p>PayPal or bank transfer. PayPal preferred as it's safer for both parties and provides transaction records. Payment terms discussed during proposal—typically 50% upfront for larger projects (£500+), or weekly/biweekly invoices for ongoing work.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>What if my project is urgent?</h4>
      <p>I can accommodate urgent and emergency fixes. Same-day or next-day turnaround is usually possible for critical bugs. Emergency work may be quoted at premium rates depending on the timeline and required schedule adjustments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>How do you handle communication?</h4>
      <p>Primarily through email or your preferred text-based platform (Slack, Discord, etc.). I provide written updates and documentation so there's always a record. Video calls available if needed, but I find asynchronous communication works better for focused development work.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>What if you can't fix my issue?</h4>
      <p>I'll be honest upfront if something is outside my expertise or not feasible. If I discover during work that the issue is more complex than expected, I'll communicate immediately and we'll discuss options. You're never charged for work that doesn't deliver results.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>Do you provide hosting or deployment?</h4>
      <p>I can deploy to your existing hosting or recommend affordable hosting solutions. I'm comfortable with cPanel, Linux servers, and modern platforms like DigitalOcean or AWS. I can also help set up CI/CD pipelines and deployment automation if needed.</p>
