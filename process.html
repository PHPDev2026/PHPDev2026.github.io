        <div class="step-content">
          <h4>Initial Discussion</h4>
          <p>Send me details about your bug or project. I'll ask clarifying questions and provide an honest assessment of timeline, approach, and cost. No pressure, no hard sell—just transparent advice on whether I'm the right fit.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="process-step">
        <div class="step-number">2</div>
        <div class="step-content">
          <h4>Proposal & Agreement</h4>
          <p>I'll outline scope, deliverables, rough timeline and cost, in writing. Once agreed, we move forward with clear expectations—no scope creep, no surprises. You'll know exactly what you're getting and when.</p>
        </div>

          <h4>Execution & Updates</h4>
          <p>I start work immediately. You receive regular written updates on progress, any issues discovered, and next steps.</p>

        <div class="step-content">
          <h4>Testing & Quality Assurance</h4>
          <p>Thorough testing throughout changes made and entire testing before delivery. I don't ship broken code. Everything is validated, tested across scenarios, and confirmed to work as expected before you see it.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>What's your typical turnaround time?</h4>
      <p>Small bug fixes: same day or next day. Medium features: 1-4 days. Complete applications: 5-10 days depending on complexity. I work fast—what others quote in weeks, I typically deliver in days. For urgent work, same-day fixes are usually possible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>What timezone are you in?</h4>
      <p>UK-based (GMT/BST). I primarily use asynchronous text communication (email, chat) which works well across timezones—we don't need to be online simultaneously. I can respond throughout the day usually, so reach out whenever you want and I'll get back to you ASAP.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>Can you work with my existing codebase?</h4>
      <p>Absolutely. I regularly work on legacy PHP code, inherited projects, and messy codebases. I can debug, refactor, extend, or optimize existing applications regardless of their current state. Even if the previous developer is gone and documentation is missing, I can figure it out.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>Do you work with Laravel specifically?</h4>
      <p>As far as frameworks, yes just Laravel. As far as work in general, I use Laravel and Blade, or HTML only, or PHP with HTML. I am open to trying other frameworks etc that use PHP, just keep in mind typically I don't touch them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>Do you sign NDAs or work agreements?</h4>
      <p>I'd prefer a trust basis as word of mouth only, but if need be - absolutely, I'm happy to sign NDAs, work-for-hire agreements, or any standard contracts. Your code and data remain completely confidential, regardless. I never reuse client code or share project details or personal information with anyone. The best anyone gets from me is another client, or another project reference. They don't need to know the specifics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>What if I need changes after delivery?</h4>
      <p>Post-delivery support is included to fix any bugs or issues that arise from my work—no additional charge for genuine bugs caused by myself.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>What payment methods do you accept?</h4>
      <p>PayPal only right now. Everything is tracked and secure, while respecting peoples privacy and personal information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>What if my project is urgent?</h4>
      <p>I do my best to accommodate urgent and emergency fixes ASAP, but as with any work and business, please keep an open mind to the fact you are not the only client and may not be the only one with urgent/emergency needs. Same-day or next-day turnaround is usually possible for critical bugs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>How do you handle communication?</h4>
      <p>Primarily through email/LinkedIn connections and messages, open to options on other platforms if need be, but I always prioritise text based. Gives us both a record of what was discussed and saves having to repeat everything over and over.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>What if you can't fix my issue?</h4>
      <p>I'll be honest upfront if something is outside my expertise or not feasible. If I discover during work that the issue is more complex than expected, I'll communicate immediately and we'll discuss options.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>Do you provide hosting or deployment?</h4>
      <p>No, I work on the code side of things only then hand the files back to you to do what you want with. My expertise and focus is purely in fixing code/creating websites from code, the rest is up to you.</p>
